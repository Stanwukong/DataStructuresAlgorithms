/** 
 * Use the class keyword to create a Thermostat class. The constructor accepts a
 * Fahrenheit temperatur
 * 
 * In the class, create a getter to obtain the temperature in Celsius and a setter to set the
 * temperature in Celsius.
 * 
 * Remember that C = 5/9 * (F - 32) and F = C * 9.0 / 5 + 32, where F is the value
 * of temperature in Fahrenheit, and C is the value of the same temperature in Celsius.
 * 
 * Note: When you implement this, you will track the temperature inside the class in one scale,
 * either Fahrenheit or Celsius.
 * 
 * This is the power of a getter and a setter. You are creating an API for another user, who can
 * get the correct result regardless of which one you track.
 * 
 * In other words, you are abstracting implementation details from the user.
